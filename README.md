# Filip KadÃºch - parallel programming and distributed systems: Documentation

## Assignment 7

#### Python version:
  3.8
#### Modules:
  - none

#### Tasks:
  Write an application that will use N (N> 2) coprograms (using advanced generators) and use your own scheduler to rotate them.
  
#### Classes:
##### 1. Dispatcher
  This class represents manager for co - programs working and running with same data
  and in the same time. Provides one mode to run tasks in loop.
  ###### Attributes:
    tasks - list of tasks to process
    loop - managing method for launching the tasks in rotating loop
    new - adds task to list
    schedule - launches task generator
    remove - close the generator and remove it from list

#### Methods: 
##### 1. find_low(data, index)
    This methods finds the lowest value in line of loaded data.
    Attributes:
        data - list of int values from 1 - 9
        index - current line index

##### 2. find_dmg(data, index)
    This methods finds the highest value in line of loaded data.
    Attributes:
        data - list of int values from 1 - 9
        index - current line index
        

Main part of our experimentation with expanded generators used
with planned execution through dispatcher. We load our entry file
and for each line data we alternatively call find_low and find_dmg
methods printing relevant information on current line. We can see in output the data progression and rotation of tasks.

```
HIGHEST line: 930: 9
LOWEST line: 930: 1
HIGHEST line: 931: 8
LOWEST line: 931: 1
```
