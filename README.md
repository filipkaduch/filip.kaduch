# Filip Kad√∫ch - parallel programming and distributed systems: Documentation

## Assignment 10

#### Python version:
  3.8
#### Modules:
    numba - JIT compiler that supports CUDA GPU
        programming by directly compiling a restricted subset of Python
        code into CUDA kernels and device functions following the CUDA execution model

    unicodedata - use for decoding of loaded corrupted text

    time - used for tracking of elapsed time of cuda processing the data

    numpy - library used for working with arrays


#### Task:
  Rework your previous solution with cuda streams and events.

#### Methods: 

##### 1. load_data()
  This method loads, cleans and saves data from corrupted file
  into array.

##### 2. edit_dist(string, string, int, int)
  This method gets word on current cuda position and we have a list of values filled up
  and here we use cuda to choose the minimal value from list of ordinals
  ASCII values.
  Attributes:
      pass_data - array of ASCII values from loaded corrupted words

### Experimentation:
  Main part of our experimentation which loads the
  dictionary of words to compare and then
  gets data from corrupted file for correction.
  It uses 50 streams with 100 events to track and
  speed up the process

#### Output for our experimentation:

### Outcome of comparison:
In the output we can see that in a simulation mode we can't really reach the potential of CUDA and the whole optimalisation process with streams and events in this case took longer than before with this architecture. Maybe a solution where we would split our data to different grid e.g.(50{corrupted text length} x 20 000 + 1 {words in dictionary to compare}) with each element being array of ASCII values from string to compare. 0th index would be used for corrupted word array of ASCII values)
